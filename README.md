# Piano Chord Practice Platform

> A minimal, focused web app for practicing piano chord recognition

**Version:** 3.0.0
**Status:** Clean Slate - Ready for Development
**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025

---

## Overview

Piano Chord Practice Platform is a clean, distraction-free Progressive Web App designed for piano students to practice chord recognition. The interface is intentionally minimal - black, white, and grey only - to maintain focus on the music.

### Core Philosophy
- **Minimalism**: Start simple, add intentionally
- **Focus**: Zero distractions, zero gamification
- **Professional**: Clean typography, thoughtful spacing
- **Offline-First**: Works without internet connection
- **User Control**: You choose what to practice

### What's NOT Included (Yet)
- ❌ Audio detection (microphone input)

## Quick Start

### Run Locally

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Serve the files locally** (required for Service Worker):
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Or using Node.js
   npx http-server

   # Or using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Start practicing!**

### Deploy to Production

This is a static site - deploy to any static hosting service:

- **GitHub Pages**: Free, easy deployment from repo
- **Netlify**: Auto-deploy from Git, custom domains
- **Vercel**: Optimized for performance
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Global CDN included

**Important**: HTTPS is required for:

```
C Major
C - E - G
Root Position
```
Shows chord name, individual notes, and inversion type.

**Minimal Display Mode**
```
C
```
Shows only the chord symbol. Great for advanced practice.

## For Developers

### Technology Stack
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No frameworks, no build tools
- **ES6+** - Modern JavaScript features
- **Service Worker** - Offline-first caching strategy
- **LocalStorage** - Settings persistence

### Development Guidelines

**Read CLAUDE.md first** - It contains comprehensive development guidelines, architectural decisions, naming conventions, and best practices for working with Claude Code on this project.

Key points:
- Keep it minimal and intentional
- Follow established naming conventions
- Test on real devices, not just DevTools
- Update documentation when adding features
- Commit working code with clear messages

### Adding Features

1. **Define the feature clearly** (What? Why? How?)
2. **Plan the implementation** (Which files? What changes?)
3. **Implement incrementally** (One logical piece at a time)
4. **Test thoroughly** (Desktop, mobile, offline)
5. **Document** (Update README and/or CLAUDE.md)
6. **Commit** (Clear message, working code)

See CLAUDE.md → "Feature Addition Process" for detailed template.

### Testing Checklist

Before committing changes:
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] All buttons/controls work as expected
- [ ] Settings persist across page reload
- [ ] Responsive design works (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Works offline (test with DevTools → Network → Offline)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Code follows naming conventions
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements

**Phase 1: Core Practice Features**
- Audio playback (play chord tones when displayed)
- Simple timer (auto-advance after X seconds)
- Session counter (track chords practiced this session)

**Phase 2: Advanced Practice**
- Sheet music notation (optional grand staff display)
- Practice statistics (accuracy, streak tracking)
- Custom practice lists (save favorite chord progressions)

**Phase 3: Interactive Features**
- Microphone input (detect chords played on real piano)
- Virtual piano keyboard (practice without instrument)
- MIDI keyboard support

**Phase 4: Learning Tools**
- Chord theory explanations
- Practice routines (guided sessions)
- Progress tracking over time

This roadmap is intentional - features build on each other systematically.

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Chrome/Edge | ✅ Full | Recommended |
| Firefox | ✅ Full | Recommended |
| Safari | ✅ Full | iOS PWA support |
| Mobile Chrome | ✅ Full | Android PWA support |
| Mobile Safari | ✅ Full | iOS PWA support |

**Minimum Requirements:**
- ES6 support
- Service Worker API
- LocalStorage API

---

## Offline Functionality

This app is **fully functional offline** once installed:

1. **First Load**: Requires internet to download assets
2. **Subsequent Loads**: Works completely offline
3. **Service Worker**: Caches all HTML, CSS, JS, fonts
4. **Storage**: Settings saved locally (no server required)

To test offline mode:
- Open DevTools → Network tab
- Check "Offline" checkbox
- Reload page - should work perfectly

---

## Performance

Current metrics (v3.0.0):
- **Bundle Size**: ~150KB total (HTML + CSS + JS + Fonts)
- **Time to Interactive**: < 1 second
- **Lighthouse Performance**: 95+
- **Offline Ready**: 100% functionality

Performance is a priority - we keep the app lightweight and fast.

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Version (v3.0.0)
- **No Audio Features**: Removed for clean slate (will re-add systematically)
- **No Statistics**: Removed for simplicity (will re-add thoughtfully)
- **Basic Chord Display**: Text only, no staff notation (planned for future)
- **Manual Progression**: User must click Skip (timer planned for future)

### Technical Constraints
- **LocalStorage Limit**: ~5-10MB per origin (not an issue for this app)
- **No Cross-Device Sync**: Settings stored locally only
- **Static Only**: No database, no user accounts

## Changelog

### v3.0.0 (October 27, 2025) - Clean Slate Release

**Philosophy**: Start fresh with minimal, focused foundation

**Added:**
- Clean splash screen with "Enter" button
- Basic chord display (name, notes, inversion)
- Display mode toggle (Full vs Minimal)
- Simple settings modal (chord type selection)
- Start/Pause and Skip controls
- Comprehensive CLAUDE.md developer guide
- Cleaned up README.md

**Removed:**
- Virtual Piano mode (all code and UI)
- Microphone audio detection
- Frequency visualizer and waveform canvas
- Sheet music notation display
- Statistics modal and tracking
- Timer bars and metronome
- Complex settings

**Why?**
Creating a solid, minimal foundation makes future development more intentional and organized. Every feature we add will be chosen deliberately rather than accumulated organically.

### v2.x (Archive)

Previous versions included virtual piano, audio detection, sheet music notation, and extensive practice features. This functionality has been archived (v2 backup saved separately) to create a cleaner starting point for v3.
